        The emergence of Yamato Court
In the early Stone Age, the Japanese archipelago was connected with the Asian continent.

People lived by hunting and gathering, using crude stone tools. In the Yayoi period, they started rice cultivation as a main livelihood and formed local groups. In 239, Himiko, the queen of Yamatai, governed about 30 local groups and sent an envoy to the Kingdom of Wei in China.

In the late 3rd century, the Yamato Dynasty, centered around the emperor, started to expand its presence. Massive kofun (tumuli) represents the power it wielded. Afterwards, Prince Shotoku and the Emperor Temmu formed a penal and administrative system based on the Chinese model. The governing center was moved to Asuka, where the Yamato court enjoyed stability. Buddhism also started to flourish in this period.
